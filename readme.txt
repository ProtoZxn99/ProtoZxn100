3. Run Zxn100.py.
4. Input the screenshot top-left coordinate and screenshot dimension.
5. Confirm if the image taken captures the chatbox fully, also take note that from now on, do not type any key from keyboard. Any key pressed will cause the script to shut down.
6. Wait until a message appears on the Discord channel or console window.
7. Close the script when done using, by manually terminating the script window or by typing "GNZ!" in the bot's Discord channel.

INTERFACE OPTIMIZATION:

If an interface blocks the code, it can be bypassed through the use of a virtual machine or softwares such as TeamViewer.
1. Please run a virtual machine containing the interface inside the virtual machine.
2. Put your character into a place with the fewest people and a static lighting, if possible set graphic quality to lowest.
3. Set your chatbox to 100% opacity and white font.
4. Run the script outside the virtual machine, aiming to interface screen inside the virtual machine.
